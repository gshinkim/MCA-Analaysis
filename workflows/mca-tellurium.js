${CONTEXT}
You are stage 1 of a fixed sequence. Your job is to frame the SCIENCE, and nothing else.
Do not choose a tool, do not write code, do not compute. Do not let a convenient
software call decide what should be computed.

Come out of this stage with the fields in your output schema.

Two different things must not be conflated, because one halts this workflow and
the other is simply its job:

  missing_from_user - the question cannot be framed at all until a human says
      something no computation can supply: no model, an ambiguous topology, no
      statement of which flux or species is meant, a regime the model does not
      cover. This HALTS the workflow. Use it sparingly and only when true.

  to_establish - not yet known, but obtainable downstream: the steady state and
      whether one exists, which parameter is perturbed, scaled versus unscaled,
      the operating point, conserved totals, whether the flux is non-zero. These
      are what stages 2 to 4 are for. Put them here and let the workflow proceed.
      Anything you would describe as "resolvable by computation" belongs here,
      never in missing_from_user.

A wrongly framed question cannot be recovered later, so frame it carefully — but
do not halt a workflow whose whole purpose is to establish what is not yet known.`,
